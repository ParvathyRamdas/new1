#Here's the Python code to solve the Red Pen Green Pen problem by calculating the number of times you need to switch between a green pen (for odd numbers) and a red pen (for even numbers):
def count_pen_switches(numbers):
    # Initialize the switch count and previous pen type
    switch_count = 0
    previous_pen = None
    
    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:  # Even number (red pen)
            current_pen = 'red'
        else:  # Odd number (green pen)
            current_pen = 'green'
        
        # Check if a switch is needed
        if previous_pen and current_pen != previous_pen:
            switch_count += 1
        
        # Update the previous pen type for the next iteration
        previous_pen = current_pen
    
    return switch_count

# Sample input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Call the function to count pen switches
result = count_pen_switches(numbers)

# Print the result
print(f"Number of pen switches: {result}")
